Sad_Nefariousness10,1722526964.0,29016,11819,I bought $700k worth of Intel stock today ,"https://preview.redd.it/83gh52szi2gd1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba99bb67e4b11aa973fe830f535c775083bbc05

TLDR: Grandma died 2 months ago. Left me $800k inheritance. I'm only a junior in college as a math major and I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education). I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing. So I told my parents I'm not going to spend a cent of this money and I'm going to invest all of it and they were proud of me. I put 100k into a high yield savings account and bought 700k worth of Intel stock at market open. I plan on holding this for a decade depending on how it performs. 

Here's why I like Intel: 

- 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY 

- Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies. 

- With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow. 

- I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding. 

- If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD 

- Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D. 

- Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024

- The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models. 

- Trading at Forward PE of 17.05 

- Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry 

- I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :)

The stock drop comes on the heels of an updated regulatory filing early Monday that showed the company taking on heavy losses and facing ""greater risks"" associated with the former president's ties to the platform.

According to the filing, Trump Media reported sales of just over $4 million as net losses reached nearly $60 million for the full year ending Dec. 31. The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.

Kazgarth_,1719402652.0,4128,1327,Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.,"Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.

Every other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.

People are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.

**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**

Currently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**

Microsoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.

If you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.

Investing in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dowoqn/why_intel_is_the_most_undervalued_tech_stock/

MaryAnnGrysbeck,1713847256.0,5890,1341,Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.,"Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.
April 22,2024

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday — an “earnout” bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday’s price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company’s majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump’s total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.

52 week high of $79.38
was on Tuesday,March 26,2024.
First day of trading under new name and stock symbol.

52 week low $12.40

The greatest show on Earth.

So let’s look back a little to understand more.

Trump Media stock jumps as much as 50% after DJT ticker debut,
Tuesday,March 26,2024

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/26/trump-media-stock-ticker-djt-debuts-after-dwac-merger.html
 
This stock has had 4 major runs in 2024 lasting from 6 to 22 days.
Obviously,from all this recent activity,this stock is nowhere near finished for 2024.

Plan accordingly.
I wouldn’t be surprised to see at least 3 more runs before November 2024.

Trump stock and options are nowhere near finished.Not with an additional 36 million more shares for Trump.Not with an election coming up.

Since we went off the gold standard, the stock market has not increased in real value. It has only preserved wealth. This can be further illustrated by dividing the S&P 500 by the M2 Money Supply.

https://preview.redd.it/q56zbzv0smbc1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f52f44ab422f53ce554e52a9b9c79ac6216a6c

But we have had gains in productivity over the last 50 years - Computers, The Internet, Automation, Globalization, Artificial Intelligence – where have all the gains in productivity gone? To the middle class? Obviously not, but let’s illustrate it anyways.

The government has effectively taxed all productivity gains in society at an average rate of 100% over the last 50 years - since we went off the gold standard.

If enough people care, I'll post a part 2 explaining how I think they've done this.

","Hey Reddit,

I'm a sailor, busting my ass on a ship and trying to build my financial future by investing in the stock market. It's my little hobby while out at sea. So, right before heading out, I left with some open positions. No big deal, right? Well, I had no internet the whole time we were out. When I finally got back to a place with internet and checked my portfolio, I was in complete shock. My investments tanked. Now I'm stuck, investing is truly my calling. What would you do in my shoes?

Coda70,1714958422.0,3116,456,This is what it looks like when you actually take money out. Protect your profits!,"I take out $10,000 a month to keep me from doing me things… Being too greedy. 

I don’t fuck with 0dte. It’s too hard to thread the needle and outpace the theta drain. Right now, I am buying July at the money calls. I pretty much just play the big boys of Mag 7. I just made a killing with Apple and Amazon monthlies, took my $10k withdrawal for May, and now I’m sitting cash waiting for a bloody day to re-enter.

I am a Permabull. The only time I went short is that the beginning of the pandemic. Stonks usually go up.

I’m usually too optimistic and get into early but if your calls still have a couple months until expiration, there is time to recover. 

I keep my account close to balanced, 50% shares and 50% calls. That way if there’s a disaster, you’ll still have your shares. I use the margin off the shares to play options.

Now that I’ve taken out $150,000 and spent it on building a bad ass guest house on my ranch there’s no way I could ever end up in the hole. The trick is finding a way to protect yourself from your own greed. It’s easy to make your account go up but most of us stay in too long and get wiped out.  If you move money into a hard asset you can’t go tits up. I learned the hard way.  Got wiped out a few times and recovered.  But now that I stick to the plan it’s been a solid extra 6 figure income for me.

My main money is in my Fidelity retirement account and RH is my play account where I do riskier plays.  

I’ve been on WSB for over 5 years.  Gained a lot of insight into sentiment so I thank you all for that.  I made this post to thank you guys and share my method for protect myself from my greed.  We’re all greedy as fuck but if you move some chips off the table after a big win you’ll be just fine.

If you want to see more about my method you can see my earlier posts about printing stoned tendies.  Good luck to us all!

Fine-Perspective-714,1691474267.0,5873,1043,MY (f19) BF (22M) JERKED OFF TO THE STOCK MARKET??," 

I know the title sounds deranged, but I swear to god im not a troll. Here’s the context:

My bf and I are long distance, so we used to have plenty of phone sex, however, that’s been happening less and less often as our relationship has gone on (according to him, he just doesn’t feel as horny as often anymore). We’ve met and had relations irl a few times, and he’s always the kind to last very long in bed, and during phone sex as well. I used to be insecure about it, thinking that maybe it was something wrong with me, but hes genuinely a great bf who constantly assures me, and has never once said anything bad about our sex life.

It should be noted that he watches plenty of porn (as do I), and neither of us see that as an issue, so this isnt about him hiding porn from me or something. We were calling today, and I was playing a game on my phone (papa’s cupcakeria, you can’t make this shit up), and after about twenty minutes of us doing our own thing, he suddenly goes “im done” and shows me his cum????? Obviously, I get really confused and ask how the hell he was jerking off this whole time without me realising (we were on video call), before mentioning that I thought he was looking at the stock market (he spends his free time just staring at the stock market for hours on end like a lunatic, but I love him so it’s whatever).

Tell me why this man then looks me in the eyes and goes “yeah, I was looking at the stock market, I was too lazy to look for porn.”

It then hits me that he literally just CAME to the stock market. When I point this out to him, all he said in response was “it’s a man thing, I didn’t wanna bother you while you were playing your game” and told me not to worry about it.

Now, I don’t want to sound insane, but I got a bit upset, because in my head, he could have very easily asked to have phone sex with me, but chose to literally jerk off to the stock market instead. To add insult to injury, he came REALLY quickly (like significantly quicker than he would during anything involving me) which makes me feel like SHIT, because there is no way the goddamn stock market is somehow more stimulating than his own damn girlfriend.

Don’t get me wrong, i’m not super genuinely upset, but you’ve gotta admit this shits gonna hurt your pride if it happened to you. I honest to god have no idea how to even move forward after this, and I just needed to type this out, because no one would believe me otherwise 💀",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15l972u/my_f19_bf_22m_jerked_off_to_the_stock_market/

Geoffs_Review_Corner,1717503246.0,2454,472,"NYSE to “bust” all the “erroneous” trades of Berkshire Hathaway stock at or below $603,718.30 a share","""Investors who purchased shares in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway yesterday at a huge discount will see their trades canceled following a technical issue on the stock exchange.

On June 3, a data glitch led the global conglomerate’s stock price to fall to $185 a share, having previously closed at over $620,000. The drop meant a more than 99% discount on the Warren Buffett-led company.

This means a trader who snapped up just $925 worth of the stock at the rock-bottom price would now see their investment worth over $3 million today.

While it hasn’t been confirmed how many people purchased the Class A stock during the technical error—which lasted for around an hour and a half—the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has swiftly undone their trades.

In an update posted at 9 p.m. last night, NYSE said it would “bust” all the “erroneous” trades of Berkshire Hathaway stock at or below $603,718.30 a share.

The issue, the exchange added, is related to a problem at the Consolidated Tape Association (CTA), which provides real-time information about quotes and trades on the exchange. The CTA oversees part of the Securities Information Processor (SIP) which consolidates all protected bid/ask quotes and trades into a single data stream.

The CTA said it experienced problems with price banding which “may have been related to a new software release” on SIP. As a result the CTA has reverted to the previous version of the software. The CTA did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

During the blip, the NYSE placed halts on certain trades, and will seek to determine which are erroneous and thus eligible to be canceled. The technical issue has now been resolved, it added, with all tickers trading as normal.

Traders who didn’t hop on a discounted Berkshire Hathaway stock but did buy heavily discounted shares in other brands will also be subject to having their trades struck off—with the ruling not eligible for appeal.

Other tickers that were impacted include American restaurant chain Chipotle (CMG), mining company Barrack Gold Corporation (GOLD) and meme stock darling"" \*redacted\*.

EdoBillions,1725103797.0,1313,622,UPDATE: What if you had just bought the highest market cap stock and rebalanced anytime a new stock took its place? PART 2,"Okay, so my last post got a good amount of comments.

 If I’m doing this right, from 1994 to 2023 this strategy averaged 22% in an extreme scenario in which you had to rebalance every year. 

However, as mentioned in the previous post, on average the rebalancing (selling 100% of the previous highest market cap stock and then buying with 100% of my portfolio the new highest market cap stock) occurred every 2.9 years. 

But what if we were to extend the back test to more than just 30 years? Here’s part 2 of this strategy: 1981-1994. This is how far back I could go, I couldn’t find yearly returns of stocks listed in the previous years. 

Again, this strategy will ONLY be applied to USA companies as so will the strategy. 

Results: from 1981 to half of 1988 the highest market cap was IBM. The returns during those years would have been: -16.19% in 1981; +69.22% in 1982; +26.75% in 1983; +0.92% in 1984; +26.30% in 1985; -22.83% in 1986; -2.89% in 1987 and +4.5% in half of 1988. 

Then XOM became the biggest market cap halfway through the year of 1988 and kept its dominance until the end of 1991. The returns would have been the following: +10% in half of 1988; +19.63% in 1989; +8.85% in 1990 and +23.30% in 1991. 

At the very start of 1992, GE became the highest market cap stock and it held its dominance throughout 1994. The returns would have been: +15.10% in 1992; +26.04% in 1993 and +0.21% in 1994. 

That leads us to an average pre tax return rate of 26.9%. With taxes, applied on the average of rebalancement during these years, which was 1 rebalancement every 2.14 years (in the calculations I considered every 2 years) we get an average after tax annual return rate of 21.27%. 


But how was the market doing during these times? From 1988 to 1994 the s&p 500 averaged an annual return rate of 13.5%.  The total backtest (part 1 and part 2) proves this strategy would have on average returned twice as much as the s&p 500 over the course of the last 37 years.

jungletrooper,1696023297.0,3770,1237,My loss today and advice for others,"This is not to illicit sympathy as I deserve none on this.  I took some bad losses by not being able to close out a Put yesterday afternoon due to bad wi fi and got stuck holding a NVDA put into this morning.  

Immediately it was at a severe loss, so I took my other plays and tried converting them over to higher outs to cover and try and make up my losses.

I ignored every rule of this
-I chased losses down
-I liquidated long term options to try and recoup with 0 day expirations
- I held to the bitter end instead of preserving capitol

Trust me, this is a person who knew what he was doing and just ignored it trying to make it all back quickly.  It’s pretty obvious gambling problem- so after the multiple times I said “I’m done” - I actually closed my account today.  Pretty much didn’t have the choice with no capitol left to invest.

What I’m going to focus on is working on other stuff including my addiction (I did take the last few dollars and put them in powerball to make it a ‘clean-sweep’ wipeout of funds).

I look forward to not waking up early for the market, or stressing out over options held overnight anymore.  And relentlessly following every board and investment site.  In a way it’s sort of freeing.  I know when I am not distracted by this, I end up working harder in other parts of my life.  So it may be a blessing in disguise.

I have faith that this is a better path for me, I have my faith that god has something better for me long term.  And if not, then I take pride knowing that some people’s lives are meant as an example/warning to others on what not to do.  If that is my role in life-so be it

My advice to others
- don’t compound losses, if you lost on something- take a step back.  Don’t try to double down or increase your exposure trying to minimize a loss
- stick to your plan, I sure didn’t and paid the price.  When it’s quickly changing prices, it’s sometimes a panic moment of throwing your game plan out the window
- take a break for a day, it’s interesting and sometimes fun to do this, but it eats up a lot of time , you don’t have to make plays everyday 
- most retail traders lose on options, it’s just the number of statistics and time- there are very few that can make real money doing it and it requires discipline to do so.  If you aren’t one of those people, maybe this isn’t for you
- yes, this is gambling if you are doing options.  Don’t try to convince yourself otherwise, this does have technical aspects of it that are skill and learning- but it is a large part of gambling on this as all the research in the world won’t overcome MMs who prop up stocks or manipulate prices.  There is so much manipulation on options to make sure you don’t cash in big - it’s why we have terms like ‘max pain’.  Because they are trying to maximize their gains- the house eventually always wins
- it’s very corrupt.  There is unlimited money going against you the retail trader, they can artificially hold up a stock price until options expire or manipulate stock issuances.  They are Billionaires (predators) and you are their prey.  They didn’t get rich by having morals or fair play in their portfolio- and they have unlimited resources to screw you over.  You can complain all you want, but there is nothing you can do about it- you chose to play their  game and it’s game rigged against you.  But as long as YOU choose to play, you are the one deciding your future.  Can’t complain about it, if you knowingly participate.
-for every winner, there are two losers.  Your winnings didn’t come artificially in a vacuum.  Someone has to lose for your gains- so be careful who you rub it into 

At the very least if one person takes a small amount of advice from this and makes some corrections in their own life for the better - then my loss definitely was worth it then.

My plan is to withdraw cash like 100$ from them and deposit it with a different bank then transfer it back to them and withdraw the same 100 $ until they run out of physical cash. I would then go around and let people know that when I tired withdrawing money from them that there was no cash to withdraw.

The fact that MOEX is closed doesn't matter because even when it opens, foreign-held shares won't be permitted to be sold there, so it's irrelevant what the share prices there will be.

Russian stocks are going to zero, and ADRs will be decoupled from their respective prices at MOEX.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t4ydnt/dont_go_into_russian_stocks/

Opening on May 3rd at $12.24, the stock price dropped a total of 8% ending the day at $11.26.

The CEO’s tweet stated “Moral Courage > College degrees” among other things encouraging protesters. He then went to end the tweet with a link to his company, telling the pro-Palestinian audience to apply. Leaving a message that protesters are hirable “regardless of university discipline.”

This situation highlights the consequences of Free Speech on business owners and investors.
Even free speech that is against what many call a genocide.

In response to this, many TikTokers in support of Palestine have created videos accentuating this event and calling for the support of the company; amassing hundreds of thousands of views & comments claiming to purchase stocks in $HIMS.

Tyler Loudon, a 42-year-old Houston man, learned this lesson the hard way. He pleaded guilty Thursday to securities fraud for buying and selling stocks based on details gleaned from his wife’s business conversations while both were working from home. He made $1.7 million in profits from the deal, but has agreed to forfeit those gains.

https://apnews.com/article/insider-trading-fraud-work-from-home-35e80f7a8bb299b0e35e4bceffb9709e

If you're gonna do it at least post the gain porn for us to see before you go to prison

Edit: I looked more into how he was caught and found this:

According to the SEC, Loudon stunned his wife by admitting he bought the shares to make enough money so she could work shorter hours.

She then notified BP and she was put on leave and then fired even though she had no knowledge he was going to do it.

She then filed for divorce.

Although I think she would wonder when they do their taxes why they owe $500k+ in taxes

1. Dropped $650k on SPX 4775 calls 3 weeks back expecting a santa rally.
2. It worked exactly the way I expected, I was up about $500k last week, should have closed my position. I was really hoping to hit a million.
3. This week has been really choppy and theta killed most of my premiums.
4. Even this morning, I was only \~25% down but the sell off that started at 10.30 AM ET killed my position.
5. Was smoking hopium all of this afternoon expecting it to go above 4775, it finally did but I already lost too much premium to save my position. I needed it to be above 4805 to be break even.
6. It still hasn't hit me fully, I'm at loss of words and mad at myself for not taking profits along the way.
7. It is what it is, hoping to have better risk management for 2024.

I can see comments of single mother putting her life savings in and college kids borrowing money at a very high interest and going all in.

This is not a joke. Losing money is not a joke. If you get a loan and buy a stock, you are at a risk. Only buy with money that you can afford to lose. Don't put your life savings or retirement corpus on this. 
For people who are getting emotional and going all in against the hedge funds, the hedge funds will have a small scratch and you would be destroyed in the end. The concept of YOLO with buying stocks works only till you don't go bankrupt.

I know this sub is now filled with a lot of new people telling you to buy the dip. Don't get emotional with money. This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life's savings when you are a single mother.

I know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with ""to the moon 🚀""
But please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks. Money ain't coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.

Stocks rose into October, when a 5-year bull market ended as the S&P 500 stock index topped out at 1,562. In January 2008, the S&P 500 entered a correction, down 10% from the peak. But when all of Bear Stearns failed two months later, stocks remained steady, buoyed by aggressive government action to contain the damage. By May, the S&P regained a few points.

> That summer, however, mounting financial losses finally started to spook investors. By July 2008, the S&P was down 20% from the prior peak—a bear market. Stocks zig-zagged for the next two months, but panic selling began after Lehman’s bankruptcy, leaving the S&P 500 down 40% from the peak nearly a year earlier. The index would ultimately lose 57% of its value by the time it bottomed out in March 2009.

The permanent layoffs are coming from Santa Clara and San Francisco County.  Typically, layoffs are bullish, but I speculate that in this case, it is **Very** **Bullish**.

Why?

# AI.

See: [ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer With $183K Salary](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary)

That's right.  Your favorite fucking slur word against bears when they make complete sense about overvaluation and bubbles and what-not.  I spek-ulate these positions will be replaced by AI, and the $183,000 engineering salary for these high cost of living areas will be put back in the pocket of the company.  Multiply that by 701 employees getting the boot, and that is $128,283,000 saved and put onto the market cap of the company, which isn't a lot, but we are just getting started with integration.  I know that is outrageously optimistic and there are sure to be HR staff, Graphic Artists, DEI Leaders, Janitors, and whatever other clowns that google has hired among some of the top salaries in the country.

Instead of losing manpower however, it is being replaced by a more agile technology that has a much lower operating cost.  This is what makes it different than your average layoff of a bloated employee pool.

Also,  What they did not disclose to the government is they have began laying off contractors in oregon for the Youtube Music Side of things.  The massive amount of subtitle work for every youtube song and podcast can now be automated.

I'm marking it as a discussion not DD since I feel it's a fairly simple strategy.

Also, if you work for google in these counties, sorry you had to hear it from me instead of a Sunday morning text saying don't come to work anymore.

The SPY is down more than -17% this year while GME stock has managed to hover at -12.70% this year-to-date.

Looking at the 6-month chart and we’ll find GameStop outperforms the S&P 500 by a long shot.

Hedge funds get paid more by fraudulently creating more shares when the stock goes under. They cannot cover anywhere near this price level because the shares don't exist. Manipulating the number of shares also dilutes the reported short float. Retail is holding on to shares they need and just not letting go, as some of those shares retail has are fraudulent. By the time they run out of money in interest payments dragging this out, it'll be a massive shitshow.

Slyver12,1612322227.0,28096,2124,GME and $80 Stocks. Why to not worry.," 

>Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!

Wrong.

No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

>WHAT?!

You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.

They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a ""30 cent stock"" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.

All the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.

I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:

**# of Shares - Price**

x 20 - $0.30c

x 80 - $5

x 400 - $20

x 600 - $40

x 900 - $60

x 2,000 - $100

x 5,000 - $150

x 10,000 - $200

x 30,000 - $300

x 50,000 - $400

x 150,000 - $500

x 1 mil - $1,000

x 15 mil - $5,000

x 30 mil - $69,420

Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.

Get it?

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.

This isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbe80d/gme_and_80_stocks_why_to_not_worry/
